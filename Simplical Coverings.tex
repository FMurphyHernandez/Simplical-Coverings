\section*{Introduction}

The theory of abstract simplicial complexes is a useful tool in the calculation of fundamental groups. This fact appears explicitly in the paper \cite{weil1960discrete} of A. Weil, .....
For any connected abstract simplicial complex $S$ is edge-path group $E(S)$ is naturally isomorphic to the fundamental group of its geometric realization $\pi_1(\vert S\vert)$. The edge-path group could be described explicitly by  generators and relations. As reference for these facts, see the book of I. Singer and J. Thorpe \cite{singer2015lecture}. 

We base our definition of covering complex given by J. Rotman in \cite{rotman1973covering}, but there are other definitions covering complex as the one in \cite{abello1991complexity}. The definition of J. Rotman

\section{Preliminaries}


We recall that, given a topological space $X$, a covering space on $X$ it's a continuous map $p\colon E\to X$, such that for every $x\in X$, there is an open neighborhood $U$ such that $p^{-1}(U)$ it is a disjoint union of open sets $U_{\lambda}$, $\lambda\in\Lambda$, and $p|_{U_{\lambda}}\colon U_{\lambda}\to U$ it's a homeomorphism. We recommend the book of P. May \cite{may1999concise} and the book of J. Rotman \cite{rotman2013introduction} as reference of covering spaces.

An abstract simplicial complex is a pair $(S,\mathcal{K})$ where $S$ is a set and $\mathcal{K}$ is a family of non-empty finite subsets of $S$ such that:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\bigcup\mathcal{K}=S$.
\item If $\sigma\subseteq \tau$ and $\tau\in \mathcal{K}$ then $\sigma\in\mathcal{K}$.
\end{itemize}
We call complexes to the abstract simplicial complexes.  If $\sigma\in \mathcal{K}$, then the dimension of $\sigma$ is $\vert\sigma\vert-1$, and we denote it by $dim(\sigma)$. The elements of $\mathcal{K}$ of dimension $n$ are called $n$-simplices, and we denote the set of $n$-simplices by $\mathcal{K}_n$. The $0$-simplices are called vertices. The dimension of $(S,\mathcal{K})$ is defined as the supremum of $dim(\sigma)$ where $\sigma$ ranges over $\mathcal{K}$, we denote it by $dim(S,\mathcal{K})$. This dimension may be infinite. We call the complex $(S,\mathcal{K})$  finite, if $S$ is finite. In particular, a finite complex has finite dimension. A complex $(S,\mathcal{K})$ is called discrete, if $\mathcal{K}=\{\{s\}\mid s\in S\}$.

An edge $e$ in $(S,\mathcal{K})$ is a pair of vertices  $(x,y)$ where $\{x,y\}\in\mathcal{K}$, $x$ is the origin of the edge $e$ and we denote it by $orig(e)$, and $y$ is the end of the edge $e$ and we denote by $end(e)$. A path $\alpha$ in $(S,\mathcal{K})$ is a finite sequence of edges $e_1,\dots,e_n$ such that $end(e_i)=orig(e_{i+1})$ with $i=1,\dots,n-1$. We define $orig(\alpha)=orig(e_1)$ and $end(\alpha)=end(e_n)$. 

A morphism between complex $(S_1,\mathcal{K}_1)$ and $(S_2,\mathcal{K}_2)$ is a map $f\colon S_1\longrightarrow S_2$ such that $f(\sigma)\in \mathcal{K}_2$ for any $\sigma\in\mathcal{K}_2$. We call a morphism of complexes a simplicial map. We  denote by $\mathcal{C}$ to the category of complexes and simplicial maps.

As reference of complexes, we recommend \cite{singer2015lecture}  and \cite{spanier1989algebraic}.

We  denote by $\mathcal{T}$ to the category of topological spaces and continuous maps.

\section{Geometric Covering Complexes}


\begin{definition}
Let $(S,\mathcal{K})$ be a complex. We say that $(S,\mathcal{K})$ is connected if for any pair of vertices $x,y$ of $(S,\mathcal{K})$ there is a path $\alpha$ such that $orig(\alpha)=x$ and $end(\alpha)=y$.
\end{definition}

The following definition is due J. Rotman in \cite{rotman1973covering}.

\begin{definition}
Let $(S,\mathcal{K})$ be a complex. A covering of $(S,\mathcal{K})$ is a pair $((T,\mathcal{L}),p)$ where $(T,\mathcal{L})$ is a complex and $p\colon T\longrightarrow S$ is a simplicial map such that:
\begin{itemize}
\item $(T,\mathcal{L})$ is a connected complex.
\item For every $\sigma\in\mathcal{K}$, $p^{-1}(\sigma)=\bigcup_{i\in I}\sigma_i$ where the family $\{\sigma_i\}_{i\in I}$ is a pairwise disjoint family of simplices of $\mathcal{L}$ such that $p|_{\sigma_i}\colon \sigma_i\longrightarrow \sigma$ is bijective.
\end{itemize}
The map $p$ is called projection and the simplices $\sigma_i$ are called sheets over $\sigma$.
\end{definition}

We observe that $p$ is surjective and $(S,\mathcal{K})$ is connected. For our geometric porpoises we need a stronger definition of covering complex.

\begin{definition}
Let $(S,\mathcal{K})$ be a complex. A geometric covering of $(S,\mathcal{K})$ is a covering $((T,\mathcal{L}),p)$ such that for any simplex $\sigma\in\mathcal{L}_n$, $p(\sigma)\in\mathcal{K}_n$. In other words, $p$ preserves the dimension of the simplices. We have that geometric coverings preserve the dimension of the complexes.
\end{definition}


\begin{proposition}
Let $(S,\mathcal{K})$ be a complex, and $((T,\mathcal{L}),p)$ a covering complex of $(S,\mathcal{K})$. If $\sigma\in\mathcal{K}$ is a maximal simplex, then $p^{-1}$ is the disjoint union of maximal simplices.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Let $\sigma\in\mathcal{K}$ be a maximal simplex with  $p^{-1}(\sigma)=\bigcup_{i\in I}\sigma_i$ where the family $\{\sigma_i\}_{i\in I}$ is a pairwise disjoint family of simplices of $\mathcal{K}$ such that $p|_{\sigma_i}\colon \sigma_i\longrightarrow \sigma$ is bijective. If $\sigma_j$ is not maximal for some $j\in I$, then there is a simplex $\tau\in\mathcal{L}$ such that $\sigma_j\subset \tau$. As $\sigma$ is maximal and $\sigma=p(\sigma_j)\subseteq p(\tau)$, we have that $p(\tau)=\sigma$. This contradicts the fact that $p$ preserves the dimension. Therefore $\sigma_i$ is a maximal simplex.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
Let  $(S,\mathcal{K})$ and $(T,\mathcal{L})$ be complexes and $f\colon (S,\mathcal{K})\longrightarrow (T,\mathcal{L})$ be a simplicial map. We say that $f$ reflects maximal simplices, if $\sigma\in\mathcal{K}$ is such that $f(\sigma)$ is a maximal simplex, then $\sigma$ is a maximal simplex.
\end{definition}


\begin{proposition}
Let $(S,\mathcal{K})$ be a finite dimensional complex, and $((T,\mathcal{L}),p)$ a covering complex of $(S,\mathcal{K})$. Then $((T,\mathcal{L}),p)$ is a geometric covering complex of $(S,\mathcal{K})$ if and only if $p$ reflects maximal simplices.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Conjetura

\section{Geometric Realization of Covering Complexes}

\begin{definition}
The geometric realization of a complex $(S,\mathcal{K})$ is the set of all function $\phi\colon S\longrightarrow [0,1]$ such that:
\begin{itemize}
\item $supp(\phi)\in\mathcal{K}$
\item $\sum_{s\in S}\phi(s)=1$
\end{itemize}
We denote this set by $\vert (S,\mathcal{K})\vert$. We can give $\vert (S,\mathcal{K})\vert$ a metric topology given by:
\[
d(\phi,\psi)=\sqrt{\sum_{s\in S}(\phi(s)-\psi(s))^{2}}
\]
for $\phi,\psi\in \vert (S,\mathcal{K})\vert$. When we endowed $\vert (S,\mathcal{K})\vert$ with the metric topology we denote it by $\vert (S,\mathcal{K})\vert_d$. There is a second topology for $\vert (S,\mathcal{K})\vert$ called the coherent topology. Foer each simplex $\sigma\in\mathcal{K}$, we define its geometric realization $\vert\sigma\vert$ as the set of functions $\phi\in \vert (S,\mathcal{K})\vert$ with $supp(\phi)\subseteq \sigma$. We give to $\vert \sigma\vert$ the subspace topology inherited as subset of $\vert (S,\mathcal{K})\vert$. If we consider the inclusion $i_\sigma\colon\vert\sigma\vert\longrightarrow \vert (S,\mathcal{K})\vert$, then coherent topology on $\vert (S,\mathcal{K})\vert$ is the largest topology which makes all the inclusions continuous. Usually, $\vert (S,\mathcal{K})\vert$ is considered with the coherent topology. We may characterize $\vert (S,\mathcal{K})\vert$ as the colimit  in $\mathcal{T}$ of the geometric realization of its simplices. So a function $f\colon\vert (S,\mathcal{K})\vert\longrightarrow X$ is continuous if and only its restrictions to $\vert\sigma\vert$ is continuous for all $\sigma\in\mathcal{K}$. Especially, the identity $\vert (S,\mathcal{K})\vert\longrightarrow \vert (S,\mathcal{K})\vert_d$ is continuous, so the coherent topology contains the metric topology. In particular, if $(S,\mathcal{K})$ is a finite complex, then both topologies coincide.
\end{definition}

Hay que decir como manda fucniones en funciones...

\begin{definition}
Let $(S,\mathcal{K})$ be a complex and $s\in S$. We define $\phi_s\colon S\longrightarrow [0,1]$ as $\phi_s(t)=\delta_{st}$ for any $t\in S$ where $\delta$ is the Kronecker's delta.
\end{definition}


\begin{proposition}
Let $(S,\mathcal{K})$ be a complex and $((T,\mathcal{L}),p)$ a finite geometric covering of $(S,\mathcal{K})$. Then $\vert (T,\mathcal{L}), p)\vert $ is covering of $\vert (S,\mathcal{K})\vert$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Let $\phi\in \vert (S,\mathcal{K})\vert$ with $supp(\phi)=\sigma\in\mathcal{K}$. We define $R=\min\{\frac{d(\phi,\phi_s}{2}\mid s\in\sigma\}$.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
Let $(S,\mathcal{K})$ be a complex and $((T,\mathcal{L}),p)$ a finite dimensional geometric covering of $(S,\mathcal{K})$. Then $\vert (T,\mathcal{L}), p)\vert $ is covering of $\vert (S,\mathcal{K})\vert$.
\end{proposition}
